# Candy-Shopping-List
This project organizes candy in a list and allows user to complete multiple functions to edit the list.

Once you run the program a question is shown and you type in a number based on what function you want to execute. The program will then repeat the same question so functions can be executed repeatedly until user chooses to end the program.
